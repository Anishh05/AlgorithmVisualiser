# AlgorithmVisualiser
Interactive tool to visualize sorting and searching algorithms for better understanding of DSA concepts......

An interactive project that helps visualize how different algorithms work step by step.
It is mainly built for learning purposes, so students and beginners can understand the working of algorithms more easily through animations.

--> Features:-

  Visualizes popular sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)

  Step-by-step process of comparisons and swaps

  Random array generation for testing

  Clean and simple UI

--> Usage

  Run the program.

  Generate a random array.

  Select an algorithm to visualize.

  Watch how the algorithm works step by step.

--> Purpose

  This project was created to:

  Improve understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms

Provide an interactive learning tool

Strengthen coding and problem-solving skills
